> Checking in your node_modules directory can cause problems. As an alternative, you can use a tool called `@vercel/ncc` to compile your code and modules into one file used for distribution.

* Install `vercel/ncc` by running this command in your terminal. 
```
npm i -g @vercel/ncc
```
* Compile your `index.js` file. `ncc build index.js --license licenses.txt`
* You'll see a new `dist/index.js` file with your code and the compiled modules. You will also see an accompanying `dist/licenses.txt` file containing all the licenses of the `node_modules` you are using.
* Change the main keyword in your `action.yml` file to use the new `dist/index.js` file. `main: 'dist/index.js'`
* If you already checked in your `node_modules` directory, remove it. 
```
rm -rf node_modules/*
```
